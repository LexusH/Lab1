# Lab1
Lab 1 for CSCI 345

This project was made in the eclipse IDE, so these instructions pertain to that environment

-To run this password cracker, please begin by running the "driver" class

-You will be prompted to provide the file path to the passwords you would like cracked.

-After inputing the file path, all cracking will be automated and your results should end up in the console and in a file labled "passwords.txt" which will be in the same directory as this README.

-If passwords.txt doesn't show up in the Eclipse directory immediately after running, please check in the Folder Lab1 as it should be there!

We hope you enjoy!
